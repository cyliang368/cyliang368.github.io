Riverine topography (bathymetry) is usually measured by boat-mounted ecosounders. The survey path could be irregular in practice. A Python package is designed to automatically detect the proper location for cross-sections and interpolation to create a dense mesh. Another Python package is developed to merge the land topography and river bathymetry to form comprehensive topobathy, which is critical for flooding simulation and watershed management.
