I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Civil Engineering at Purdue University. I am also studying a concurrent M.S. program in Computer Engineering. My research focuses on applying parallel computing and deep learning to large-scale geospatial data. I am conducting a research project funded by NSF, which is constructing a web platform to share, process, and predict geospatial information. I can write efficient codes in Python, C/C++, Shell Scripts, etc.
